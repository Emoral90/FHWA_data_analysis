# Overview

This program will serve the purose to organize and present civil penaltiy data from the Nation Highway Transportation Safety Administration. There are absurd amounts of data kept by the NHTSA for accounting purposes. Ultimately, the goal is to show specific correlations between these data entries in order to aid future accountants and/or data analysts in their work and help reach a decision based on the data visualized.

# Data Analysis Results

## Questions
1. Can a request be made to a remote API to pull data instead of downloading the file(s)?
2. Can the data be sorted by specific filters?
3. Can correlations in the data be visualized?
